[BurageSnap](https://osdn.jp/projects/buragesnap/) allows you to take screenshots of browser games a.k.a ブラゲ [burʌgɛ] in Japanese with just one click.

BurageSnap automatically finds a game screen and saves it as a JPEG or PNG file. In the burst mode, BurageSnap continuously captures the screen and saves it as an animated GIF file. 

BurageSnap finds the last focused window running one of the games specified in advance and recognizes a large rectangle surrounded by white pixels in the window as a game screen. The rectangle can have rounded or vague corners.

BurageSnap can work on Windows 8.1 or 10.
